# L6-Hash
L6 Hash Table Exercise


Task 1:
- Implement a HashFunction() using an appropriate algorithm (e.g., mid-square, ASCII conversion)
- Modify HashAdd() to deal with collisions correctly
- Implement PrintInfo() to print out the hash table and load factor information

Task2:
- Implement and test a Find() method to find a value in the hash table
- Extend the test data by adding more data to test your collision code and Find() method

Extension:
- Implement and test a method to delete a value from the hash table
- Implement a rehash method: returns a new/bigger/better hash table. This is hard!

In all cases:
1) Comment your code
2) Provide suitable testing 
3) Provide suitable commentary to your testing
